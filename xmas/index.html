<h1 style="font-size:450%">Santa Clause!</h1>
<p style="font-size:150%">
	Santa once had pirate friends<br />
	But then they met their bitter ends.<br />
	Now he lives the pirate way<br />
	Giving &amp; kicking booty on Christmas Day.<br />
<br />
	He's got a present you'll think is pleasant<br />
	That came from somebody who is no longer present.<br />
	Yes, it's Dottie who has passed away<br />
	But a bit of her inheritance will help you play.<br />
<br />

	So look in a car with a steering wheel.<br />
	The one we call the Grandma-mobile.<br />
