block song

	p
		b This is a breakup song. But unlike most breakup songs,
		|
		| this takes place before the breakup and is from the perspective of the person finding that they need to initiate it. It’s about the turmoil in deciding to put an end to a relationship that isn’t quite cutting it.

	p.
		Starting with an acoustic foundation, then morphing into a percussion-heavy atmosphere — Layers of acoustic drums and percussion layered with a mainstream trap beat — conveying the stress, frustration and pain in the lyrical content.


	


block lyrics
	pre.lyrics.
		I feel boxed in
		Like a bird in a cage who’s just stuck
		Aside from my heart
		Well the cage has everything I want 

		But I wish I could fly
		Just spread my wings and fly
		But I can’t 
		Yea I can’t with you in my life

		‘Cause no road I take will leave us both okay 
		No path I choose will make things right 
		No choice I make will end with us feeling good
		So all I can do is drown in my thoughts tonight

		You‘ve been good, yeah you treated me well no matter what 
		Everything feels right, just except for my heart   

		It’s not like it was before 
		Things feel different,  now I don’t belong here
		All the memories of us that were good are now gone 

		‘Cause no road I take will leave us both okay 
		No path I choose will make things right 
		No choice I make will end with us feeling good
		All I can do is drown in my thoughts tonight

		Today’s gonna be the day
		Don’t know what I’m gonna say
		There’s no way to do this where it won’t hurt
		So just tell me I’m gonna be alright and it won’t get worse 

		‘Cause no road I take will leave us both okay 
		No path I choose will make things right 
		No choice I make will end with us feeling good
		All I can do is drown in my thoughts tonight
