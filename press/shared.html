</h1><div class="clearfix"><a href="/photos/orig/Lorenzo%20Wood%206190.jpg"><img class="bio" src="/photos/Lorenzo%20Wood%206190.jpg"/></a><p>Lorenzo Wood is an award-winning musician, songwriter, producer, and vocalist from the San Francisco area. His heartfelt, honest lyrics present a personal perspective of friendships, relationships, and coming of age in the modern era of social media. His songs, rooted in the pop genre, borrow from a number of different musical styles to create a distinctive mix of real instruments and electronic sounds.
</p><p>In addition to recording and producing songs and videos in his home studio, Lorenzo performs live, solo or with a band. With a skillset of music performance technology, he puts together unique, intricate live setups that make his performances stand out. </p><p>Lorenzo lists Maroon 5, Train, U2, Shawn Mendes, and John Mayer as his initial musical influences. But now he feels his style resembles more that of artists like Bazzi, Julia Michaels, Post Malone, and Jonas Brothers.
</p></div><h3>Performance</h3><p>Lorenzo has been performing and recording his songs since a young age. At age 13, he discovered busking, and has been performing primarily at street festivals in the San Francisco Bay Area every summer/fall since then.
</p><p>In 2018, while releasing his first EP at the age of 15, he put together and hired a band to play the newly released songs with him on stage. He performed again in 2019 with a new lineup.
</p><p>Lorenzo has also performed as a member of several local bands. Recently he has supported Kat Van Morgan, Saint Benjamin, and others, playing whatever instruments were needed.
</p><p>For many of his own performances and those of others, Lorenzo coordinates and runs live sound, being knowledgeable and experienced with most audio and musical equipment.

</p><p>He is also versed at video production, creating videos both for his own songs as well as others, such as performance videos for <a href="https://samjohnsonlive.com">Sam Johnson</a>.
</p><p>Lorenzo enjoys collaborating with other musicians.  He brought singer/songwriter Kaia onboard as a featured vocalist for the acoustic version of his 2019 single "Jacket"; Working with Andrew Wilson, he co-wrote and sang on "You and Me Now", and produced the vocals on "Lonely." Lorenzo plans for more collaborations and featured artists in his upcoming releases.
</p><h3>Awards</h3><p>Lorenzo was a merit winner in the 2020 <a href="http://www.youngarts.org/winners">National YoungArts Foundation</a> in the category of Voice/Singer-Songwriter.
